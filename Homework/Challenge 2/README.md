# Module 2 - Written Summary
## Project Overiew
This project involved Microsoft Visual Basic, a coding language used to communicate with microsoft products. With VBA we were able to create macros in our excel spreadsheet that allowed us to analyze the data quicker than manual entries would have been able to do. For this particular project we created macros that allowed us to sift through 2 years worth of stock data (over 6000 columns) for over 12 different stock indexes in order to give the best stock advice to our clients, in this case the parents of our stakeholder. We did this by showing the Return for a stock, and if that stock were green (as formatted in excel) it would have been a solid choice. If red, then we would stray away from that stock index.
